# SQLMap
> sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers.

Some websites will have SQL databases connected to them.
- Often a db is used to provide dynamic content and give the user some persistence across sessions.
- WordPress is a common site application that uses a db to store content and user data. 
- When a web application allows user input that interacts with the db, we can attack that.
