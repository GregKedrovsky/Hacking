# Burp Suite
> Burp offers multiple capabilities such as web crawler, scanner, proxy, repeater, intruder and many more

## Passively Spider a Website
> A web crawler (also known as a web spider or web robot) is a program or automated script which browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner. If you tunnel web traffic through Burp Suite (without intercepting the packets), by default it can passively spider the website, update the site map with all of the contents requested and thus creating a tree of files and directories without sending
any further requests.
1. Set up Burp as your proxy in Firefox.
2. Turn off Interceptor in Burp
3. Click through some pages (should spider / record them)
