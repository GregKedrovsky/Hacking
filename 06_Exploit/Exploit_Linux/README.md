## Overview 

- Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is comprised of the Linux kernel, which was developed by Linus Torvalds, and the GNU toolkit, which is a collection of software and utilities that was started and developed by Richard Stallman.
- This combination of open-source software is what makes up the Linux O/S as a whole, and it is commonly referred to as GNU/Linux.
- Linux has various use cases. However, it is typically deployed as a server operating system. For this reason, there are specific services and protocols that will typically be found running on a Linux server.
- These services provide an attacker with an access vector that he can utilize to gain access to a target host.
- Having a good understanding of what these services are, how they work, and their potential vulnerabilities is a vitally important skill to have a penetration tester.
