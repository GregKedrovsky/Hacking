# Exploiting Samba
> SMB is the Server Message Block network file sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals between computers on a LAN. Samba is the Linux implementation of SMB and it allows Windows systems to access Linux shares and devices.

Samba (SMB) Default Port: `445`
- SMB originally ran on top of NetBIOS using port `139` and you can still find machines that run both (for backwards compatibility).
