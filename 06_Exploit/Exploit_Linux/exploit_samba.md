# Exploiting Samba
> SMB is the Server Message Block network file sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals between computers on a LAN. Samba is the Linux implementation of SMB and it allows Windows systems to access Linux shares and devices.

Samba (SMB) Default Port: `445`
- SMB originally ran on top of NetBIOS using port `139` and you can still find machines that run both (for backwards compatibility).

### Susceptible to Attacks
- Samba is susceptible to the same attacks as Windows.
  - PsExec
  - CrackMapExec
  - MetaSploit module(s)

### Exploiting Samba
- Samba utilizes username and password authentication in order to obtain access to the server or a network share.
- We can perform a brute-force attack on the samba server in order to obtain legitimate credentials.
  - [Hydra](../../hydra.md) is your friend.
- After obtaining legitimate credentials, we can use a utility called [SMBMap](../../04_Enumeration/enum_smb.md) to enumerate samba sare drives. It can also list the contents of the shares as well as download files and execute remote commands on the target.
