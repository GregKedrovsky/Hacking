# Searching for Exploits

**This is your next step:**
1. You did your host discovery and found a target.
2. You scanned your target and found open ports.
3. You scanned those ports for service and service version information.
4. You then took that service/version info and found what might be an exploitable vulnerability.
5. Now... you need to search for some potential exploits.

## Searching for Public Exploits
- After identifying a potential vulnerability within a target or a service running on a target, the next logical step will involve searching for exploit code that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
- Exploit code can easily be found online.
  - However, it is important to note that downloading and running exploit code against a target can be quite dangerous.
  - It is therefore recommended to analyze the exploit code closely to ensure that it works as intended.
- There are a handful of legitimate and vetted exploit databases that you should use when searching for exploits online...

## [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
- This is an online, comprehensive database of publicly available exploits. 

## [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)
- Rapid7 owns and maintains the MetaSploit project
- Search this db for exploits.
  - NOTE: The "Type" filter includes: Module and Vulnerability
- This db is a repo of "vetted" exploits and exploitable vulnerabilities.
- This is the best place to look for exploits available in Metasploit modules.

## [Google Dorks](../01_Recon/recon1_passive.md#google-dorks)
- Remember that you can fine tune your Google searches to find what you need from sites you trust.
- Sites you can search:
  - `site:exploit-db.com`
  - `site:rapid7.com`
  - `site:github.com`  (which is a bit of a crap shoot for finding legit code)

## [Packet Storm](https://packetstormsecurity.com/)
- This is not really an exploit database.
- It is an information security website that provides you with information about new vulnerabilities.
