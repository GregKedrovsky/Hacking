# Exploitation

## What is "exploitation"?
- Exploitation consists of techniques and tools used by adversaries and pentesters to gain an initial foothold on a target system or network.
- Successful exploitation will heavily depend on the nature and quality of information gathering and service enumeration performed on the target.
  - We can only exploit a target if we know what is vulnerable.

## Exploitation Methodology (based on the [PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page)): 
1. Identify vulnerable services
2. Identify and prepare exploit code
3. Gain access (via the execution of you exploit code)  
  a. Automated (e.g., MSF)  
  b. Manual  
4. Obtain remote access on a target system
5. Bypass AV detection
6. Pivot on to other systems
