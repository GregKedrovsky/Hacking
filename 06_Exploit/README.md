# Exploitation

## What is "exploitation"?
- Exploitation consists of techniques and tools used by adversaries and pentesters to gain an initial foothold on a target system or network.
- Successful exploitation will heavily depend on the nature and quality of information gathering and service enumeration performed on the target.
  - We can only exploit a target if we know what is vulnerable.

## Exploitation Methodology (based on the [PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page)): 
1. Identify vulnerable services
2. Identify and prepare exploit code
3. Gain access (via the execution of you exploit code)  
  a. Automated (e.g., MSF)  
  b. Manual  
4. Obtain remote access on a target system
5. Bypass AV detection
6. Pivot on to other systems 

## This is your next step...
1. You did your host discovery and found a target.
2. You scanned your target and found open ports.
3. You scanned those ports for service and service version information.
4. You then took that service/version info and found what might be an exploitable vulnerability.
5. Now... you need to **_search for some potential exploits_.**

## Searching for Public Exploits
- After identifying a potential vulnerability within a target or a service running on a target, the next logical step will involve searching for exploit code that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
- Exploit code can easily be found online.
  - However, it is important to note that downloading and running exploit code against a target can be quite dangerous.
  - It is therefore recommended to analyze the exploit code closely to ensure that it works as intended.
- There are a handful of legitimate and vetted exploit databases that you should use when searching for exploits online:
  - [Exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
  - [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)
