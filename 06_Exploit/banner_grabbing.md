# Banner Grabbing

## Netcat
- Banner Grabbing with Netcat:
```
nc [target ip] [target port]
```

## Authenticating
- Banner grabbing by authentication. You do not need legitimate credentials. Example: 
```
ssh root@[target ip]
```
- Instead of printing out the service and version, it prints out a welcome banner
- That's just what you get sometimes... Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't.
