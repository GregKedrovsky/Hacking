# Enumeration
> Enumeration is essential for an attack to be successful, since wasting time with exploits that either do not work or can crash the system can be a waste of energy. It is important to try every angle when enumerating, as the information you gather here will inform your exploitation stage.

## Enumeration Defined
> The action of mentioning a number of things one by one (i.e., making lists).
