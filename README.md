# Hacking

This is a repo-in-process for my notes as I work through some training courses for three certifications: 
1. [eJPT](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/) (done; passed the exam)
2. [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) (currently in process)
3. [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/) (on the radar for 2025)

And, obviously, there some [THM](https://tryhackme.com/), [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.com/), and [Python](https://github.com/GregKedrovsky/Python) along the way.

This is an "organize as you go" project.
- I had no idea how to organize my notes, so I just started dumping in things I needed and needed to remember.
- Then when I had time and inspiration, I gave it a little structure and organization.
- Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

## Robert Morris's 3 Rules

The three golden rules to ensure computer security are: 
1. do not own a computer; 
2. do not power it on; 
3. and do not use it.
