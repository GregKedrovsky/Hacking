# Vulnerability Assessment

## Tool: [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials)
> Nessus Essentials is free. So we use that one...

### Local Server
- Nessus runs on a server (which might be your own local machine). Start it up in a browser: `https://localhost:8834/`

### Scan Target
- We start Nessus on our machine and then use it to scan a separate machine on the network: `demo.domain.local`

- When Nessus starts up, it asks what your target is. Plug in the `demo.domain.local` address above.
- Enter. Select the IP that comes up. Run Scan.
- This will run a Basic Network Scan

### Host Discovery Scan
- The "My Host Discovery Scan" is the initial scan Nessus ran. 
- You can see the details of what Nessus did (ping test, etc.)

### Basic Network Scan 
- Once finished, the "My Basic Network Scan" will have the results of the scan we ran on the demo site.
- Top right: Report.  Export to different formats... and chose what to export. Complete Report.

### Vulnerability Scan
- Create a new scan: Go back to "My Scans" and click button to create a New Scan.
  - Choose "Advanced Scan"
  - Name it whatever: Advanced Network Scan
  - Description: whatever... a slightly more advanced scan of the demo site
  - Target: demo.domain.local
  - Discovery...
