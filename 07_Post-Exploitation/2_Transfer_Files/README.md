## Python Web Server

### Setting up a Web Server with Python
- Python comes with a built-in modules for spinning up a simple web server.
- These modules can be used to facilitate a simple HTTP server that gives you standard GET and HEAD request handlers.
- These modules can be used to host files in any directory of your system.
- The modules can be implemented through a single command on your terminal.

### Python 2
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```
- `-m` : module
- `80` : port (you can use any that are available)

### Python 3 
```
python3 -m http.server 80
```
- `-m` : module
- `80` : port (you can use any that are available)

## Transfer Files To Windows: `certutil`
- crtutil is a command-line utility in a Windows OS that lets you manage and manipulate certificates and certificate services.
- It can also be used on a Windows machine to transfer files, much like **wget** in Linux.
```
certutil -urlcache -f http://[target ip]/filename.exe filename.exe
```
- `-urlcache` : display or delete URL cache entries. ([Documenation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil#-urlcache))
- `-f` : forces a fetch of the specified URL and then updates the cache

## Transfer Files To Linux: `wget`
- Download the remote file to the current working directory from whence you executed wget:
```
wget http://[remote ip]/[remote filename] 
```
