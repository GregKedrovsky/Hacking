# Transfer Files with Netcat

This will send the contents of the file "file.name" from the source file.name and save it in the target file.name. 
- So, it's not actually sending the file; it's sending the file contents.
- I've only tested this with text-based files. It works seamlessly.

Initialize the target listening to the port: 
```
nc -vl 44444 > file.name
```

Send the file to target:
```
nc -n [target_ip] 44444 < file.name
```
