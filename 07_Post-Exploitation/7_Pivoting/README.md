## Intro

### What is Pivoting?
- Pivoting is a post-exploitation technique that involves utilizing a compromised host (that is connected to other systems and/or networks) to attack other systems on the compromised host's networks (and there could be more than one: external and internal).
  - Pivoting can involve using a compromised target to access other networks to which that target is connected.
  - Or pivoting can involve using a compromised target to access other hosts and resources on the same network (if it is not connected to other networks).
- After gaining access to one host, we can use the ompromised host to exploit other hosts on the same internal network to which we could not access previously.
- Meterpreter provides us with the ability to add a network route to the internal network's subnet and consequently scan and exploit other systems on the network.

### Port Forwarding
- In order to understand pivoting, you need to understand port forwarding.
- Port forwarding is the process of redirecting traffic from a specific port on a target system to a specific port on our (attack) system.
- Consider the following set-up as an example:
  - The external network (open to the public) is 192.168.1.0/24
  - The internal network (not open to the public) is 10.10.10.0/24
  - In order to reach the internal network, we need to compromise vic-1 and then use it to "pivot" to compromise vic-2 via our access to vic-1.

|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| Kali    | 192.168.1.2 |     none    | attack machine  |
| Vic-1   | 192.168.1.3 | 10.10.10.2  | used as a pivot |
| Vic-2   | 10.10.10.3  |     none    |   final target  |
