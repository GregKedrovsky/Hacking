## Intro

### What is Pivoting?
- Pivoting is a post-exploitation technique that involves utilizing a compromised host (that is connected to other systems and/or networks) to attack other systems on the compromised host's networks (and there could be more than one: external and internal).
  - Pivoting can involve using a compromised target to access other networks to which that target is connected.
  - Or pivoting can involve using a compromised target to access other hosts and resources on the same network (if it is not connected to other networks).
- After gaining access to one host, we can use the ompromised host to exploit other hosts on the same internal network to which we could not access previously.
- Meterpreter provides us with the ability to add a network route to the internal network's subnet and consequently scan and exploit other systems on the network.

### Port Forwarding

| Machine |    eth0     |    eth 1    |   Description   |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| Kali    | 192.168.1.2 |     none    | attack machine  |
| Vic-1   | 192.168.1.3 | 10.10.10.2  | used as a pivot |
| Vic-2   | 10.10.10.3  |     none    |  final target   |

- In order to understand pivoting, you need to understand port forwarding.
- Consider the above table as an example:
  - The external network (open to the public) is 192.168.1.0/24
  - The internal network (not open to the public) is 10.10.10.0/24
  - In order to reach the internal network, we need to compromise vic-1 and then use it to "pivot" to compromise vic-2 via our access to vic-1.
- Port forwarding is the process of redirecting traffic from a specific port on a target system to a specific port on our (attack) system.
  - We would forward a specific port on vic-2 to our Kali attack machine (forward all the traffic the port on vic-2 receives to a port on our attack machine).
  - This way we can access that port on vic-2 via the port on our local Kali attack machine (because it is receiving the port forwarded from vic-2).
  - If we don't forward the vic-2 port to a port on our Kali machine, we would need something like Nmap on vic-1 in order to do a version scan (`-sV`) on open ports on vic2.
    - We can do a **_port_** scan on vic-2 via vic-1 (MetaSploit provides that functionality).
    - But we cannot do a **_version_** scan on the ports we find open on vic-2.
    - So we need to forward open ports on vic-2 to our Kali machine, and then we can run Nmap `-sV` on the port we chose on our Kali machine to receive the forwarded port from vic-2.
- In the context of pivoting, we can forward a remote port on a previously inaccessible host (vic-2) to a local port on our Kali machine, and in this way we can remotely interact with and exploit the service running on the port.

### Resources & Links
- We are going to use the MetaSploit Framework and Meterpreter to perform our pivoting.
  - MSF and meterpreter already have the necessary tools built into them.
  - This will make it much easier to understand the concepts and techniques.
- NOTES:
  - I followed the [MetaSploit Pivoting Documentation](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/intermediate/pivoting-in-metasploit.html) because the `run autoroute` Meterpreter Script is deprecated. It does appear to still work, though.
  - I used an [online subnet calculator](https://www.adminsub.net/ipv4-subnet-calculator/) to find the subnet and netmask of the networks I was working on (external and internal).
