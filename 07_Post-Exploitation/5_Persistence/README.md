# Persistence

## Establishing Persistence
- Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
  - Techniques used for persistence include any access, action, or configuration changes that let them maintain their foothold on systems.
  - Example: Replacing or hijacking legitimate code or adding startup code.
- Gaining an initial foothold is not enough. You need to set up and maintain persistent access to your targets.
- Persistence is usually performed after privilege escalation because you often need elevated privileges to establish the persistence on the machine.

## Caution
- Persistence techniques can interfere with the functionality of the target operating system.
- The persistence technique you use will need to be in accordance with the rules of engagement laid out and agreed up with the client.
