# Clearing Your Tracks

## Keep Notes
- Keep notes of what you transferred and what the MSF put on the target system!
  - Make a separate note file of "Clean Up"
  - It should be a running list (add to it each time you do something that needs to be cleaned up afterward).
- And then at the end of the pentest, use this "Clean Up" note file as a check list to cover your tracks
