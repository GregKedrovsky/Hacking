## Intro

### Windows Password Hashes
- The Windows O/S stores hashed user account passwords locally in the SAM database.
  - `SAM` : Security Accounts Manager
- Hashing is the process of converting a piece of data into another value. A hashing function or algorith is used to generate the new value. The result of a hashing algorithm is know as a **_hash_** or a **_hash value_**.
- Authentication and verification of user credentials is facilitated by the LSA.
  - `LSA` : Local Security Authority
- This all ties into the LSASS process.
  - `LSASS` : Local Security Authority Subsystem Service
- Windows versions up to Windows Server 2003 utilize two different types of hashes:
  - `LM` : LAN Manager authentication protocol
  - `NTLM` : Network Trust Level Manager
- Windows disabled LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing from Windows Vista onward. 

### SAM Database
- The SAM (Security Account Manager) is a database file that is responsible for managing user accounts and passwords on Windows. All user account passwords stored in the SAM database are hashed.
  - The SAM database on Windows is similar to the `/etc/shadow` file on Linux
- The SAM database file cannot be copied while the operating system is running.
- The Windows NT kernel keeps the SAM database file locked and as a result, attackers typically utilize in-memory techniques and tools to dump SAM hashes from the LSASS process.
  - **NOTE:** Elevated/Administrative privileges are required in order to access and interact with the LSASS process.
  - You're probably going to need PrivEsc to be able to dump hashes.
- In modern versions of Windows, the SAM database is encrypted with a `syskey`.
