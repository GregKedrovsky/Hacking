## Contents
- []()

## What are we looking for?
- Current IP address & network adapter
- Internal networks
- TCP/UDP services running and their respective ports
- Other hosts on the network
- Routing table
- Windows firewall state

## ipconfig
- This will give us the target's IP address, current adapters (and their configurations, gateways, etc.)

## ipconfig /all
- This provids the Windows IP configuration, the MAC address, DNS server, DHCP server, etc.

## route print
- Print out the routing table

## arp -a
- Displays the arp table and all information (list of all devices on the LAN)

## netstat -ano
- This will display a list of services that are currently running and what port they are running on.
- `-a` : Displays all active TCP connections and the TCP and UDP ports on which the computer is listening.
- `-n` : Displays active TCP connections, however, addresses and port numbers are expressed numerically and no attempt is made to determine names.
- `-o` : Displays active TCP connections and includes the process ID (PID) for each connection.
