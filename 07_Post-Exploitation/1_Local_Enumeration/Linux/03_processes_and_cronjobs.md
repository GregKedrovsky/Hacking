## Intro & Overview
- After gaining initial access to a target system, it is always important to learn more about the system like...
  - What processes are running?
  - What services are running?
  - What tasks are scheduled to run when?
- What are we looking for here?
  - Running services
  - Cron Jobs
 
## Meterpreter
> Assuming you compromised the target via MetaSploit and were able to obtain a meterpreter session.

```
ps                    # List out the current processes on the target system
pgrep [process name]  # Filter ps with a grep-like filter
```

## Manual
> With shell access...

```
/bin/bash -i       # Open a shell session from meterpreter. Issue this command to get an interactive shell.
ps                 # Linux utility that lists out the current processes running on the system
ps aux             # Different format for the above, and includes all processes
top                # Displays system-performance information dynamically (showing which processes are consuming processor and memory resources).
crontab -l         # (lower-case "L") List out the contents of the cron table (list cron jobs)
ls -la /etc/cron*  # Displays all the cron files where cron jobs would be stored. 
cat /etc/cron*     # cat out the contents of the cron files (i.e., show the cron jobs configured).
```
