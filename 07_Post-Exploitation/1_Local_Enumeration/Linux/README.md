# Linux Privilege Escalation

## Remember the 5 Stages of a Hack
1. Information Gathering
2. Scanning & Enumeration
3. Exploitation
4. Persistence
5. Covering Your Tracks

In order to have gained this low-level access, you had to work through the first three stages.
- Now you just need to repeat that same three-step process on this compromised machine.
- You need more ***enumeration*** so you know what you have, what you're looking at, what you have to work with.
  - We first look for the "quick wins" (the easy paths).
  - If we don't find one, then we dig deeper.
- And, as you come across new escalation paths, you'll need to enumerate there, also (so you know what you have, what you have to work with, etc.).

## First: Quick Wins
- Do you scanning and enumeration, looking for an easy path to escalation (a quick win; low-hanging fruit).
- If that doesn't get you anywhere, then you'll have to dig deeper.

## Quick Wins:

Look for "quick wins" as soon as you gain access:
1. Find out who you are on the compromised machine.
2. Find out the architecture of the compromised machine.
3. Find out what sudo privileges you have.
4. Find out what history is available to me.
