#Linux Privilege Escalation

## First: Quick Wins
- Do you scanning and enumeration, looking for an easy path to escalation (a quick win; low-hanging fruit).
- If that doesn't get you anywhere, then you'll have to dig deeper.

## Overview of Quick Wins:
1. Find out who you are on the compromised machine.
2. Find out the architecture of the compromised machine.
3. Find out what history is available to you on the compromised machine.
4. Find out what sudo privileges you have on the compromised machine.
