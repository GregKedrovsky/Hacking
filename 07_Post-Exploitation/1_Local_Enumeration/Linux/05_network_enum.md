## Intro & Overview
- What are we looking for...?
  - Current IP address & network adapter
  - Internal networks
  - TCP/UDP services running and their respective ports
  - Other hosts on the network
 
## Meterpreter
> Assuming you compromised the target via MetaSploit and were able to obtain a meterpreter session.

```
ifconfig  # current network details
netstat   # Get a list of currently running TCP and UDP services.
          # You should be able to see your connection from the Kali IP address via the port specified in the MSF meterpreter upgrade. 
route     # Display the routing table; gives you the gateway IP address
arp       # Display the ARP table (MACs mapped to IPs)
```

## Manual
> With shell access...

```
/bin/bash -i          # If you're in meterpreter, either switch to your shell session or just type `shell` and drop into a shell on the system.
                      # The command above will get you into an interactive Bash session. 
ifconfig              # linux command to display network information; if this does not work, try the following
ip -c a               # Diplays network adapters and their relevant information
cat /etc/networks     # This file contains a list of interfaces and their IP addresses
cat /etc/hostname     # Display the name of the computer/host.
cat /etc/hosts        # A list of IP addresses mapped to specific names
cat /etc/resolv.conf  # This file contains DNS server (nameserver) information
arp -a                # Display the ARP table
```
