## Linux Local Users & Groups Enumeration
- After gaining initial access to a target system, it is always important to learn more about the system like, what user account you have access to and other user accounts on the system.
- What are we looking for?
  - Current user and privileges
  - Other users on the system
  - Groups that have been configured on the target system

## Techniques & Tools

### Meterpreter 
> Assuming you compromised the target via MetaSploit and were able to obtain a meterpreter session.
```
getuid   # uid=0 is the root user
```

### Manual 
> With shell access...

#### `/bin/bash -i`
- If you have access via meterpreter, issue the command `shell` and then the above to get an interactive Bash Shell on the target.

#### `cd /root`
- See if you can get into that directory and look around.

#### `whoami1
- Identify which user I have compromised

#### `groups`
- List the groups configured on the system

#### `groups [username]`
- Display the groups in which the specified user is a member.
- If your non-privileged user is part of the root group of the sudo group, then you have root privileges available to you.

#### `cat /etc/passwd`
- List out out the users on the target system
- You get both user accounts (with /home/) directories and service accounts ("nologin")

#### `w`
- Show who is logged on and what they are doing. Man Page.

#### `who`
- Show who is logged on.

#### `last`
- Looks through the file wtmp (which records all logins/logouts) and prints info about connect times users.

#### `lastlog`
- Display a list of users who have logged into the sytem, the port they used, and their remote IP if connecting remotely
