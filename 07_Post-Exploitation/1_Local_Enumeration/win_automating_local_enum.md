## Intro

### Why Automate?
- In addition to performing local enumeration manually, we can also automate the process with the help of a few scripts and MSF modules.
- While local enumeration techniques and commands are important to know, as a pentester you will need to be time efficient. As a result you will need to learn how to utilize various automated enumeration scripts.
- In addition to automating the process of enumerating information like system information, users, and groups, these automated enumeration scripts will also provide you with additional information regarding the target system like:
  - privilege escalation vulnerabilities
  - locally stored passwords
  - etc.

### Windows Local Enum Scripts: JAWS
- JAWS: [Just Another Windows (Enum) Script](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS)
- JAWS is a PowerShell script designed to help pentesters (and CTFers) quickly identify potential privilege esclation vectors on Windows systems.
- JAWS is written using Powershell 2.0 so it should run on every Windows version since Windows 7.

## Techniques & Tools

### Automation with MetaSploit
> This is post-exploitation. We are assuming you have compromised a Windows target and have an unprivileged meterprreter session.

#### `show_mount`
- This is a meterpreter command. Run it in your meterpreter session.
- This will list out the mounts and drives on the target system (remember: this is a meterpreter command, not an msfconsole command).
- **Background your meterpreter session.**
  - The following are MetaSploit modules.
  - Several (if not all) of the following use the meterpreter session to run
  - Therefore you still need the meterpreter session. Just background it and take note of the session ID number.
  - Search for the name indicated below.

#### `win_privs`
- This will display the currect user's privileges
- Set options and run
- Pretty much the same as getprivs command in meterpreter; it does provide a little more info, though.

#### `enum_logged_on_users`
- Enumerates the users currently logged onto the target system in addition to the recently logged on users.
- set options and run

#### `checkvm`
-This module will check to see if the target is a virtualmachine
- There are 3 flavors of this module: linux, solaris, windows.  Select the Windows version...
- set options and run

#### `enum_applications`
- Enumerate installed programs and applications on the target system
- You might be able to find a program or application that has a vulnerability you could exploit, specifically a priv esc exploit.
- set options and run

#### `enum_computers`
- This module will enumerate the other systems on your target's network
- use it... set options... run
- This will provide you with information about computers related to the target system

#### `enum_patches`
- Enumerate the patches (updates and hotfixes) that have been applied to the target system and when (the date) they have been installed.
- set options and run

#### `enum_shares`
- Enumerates a list of SMB shares accessible from the target system
- set options and run
