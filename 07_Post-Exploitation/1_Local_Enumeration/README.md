# Local Enumeration

This is post-exploitation. You have compromised a machine and now you need to enumerate in order to find out what you have available to leverage and exploit further.

You follow the same five stages of a hack (now you are doing so from a target machine with low-level / user access): 
1. Information Gathering
2. Scanning & Enumeration
3. Exploitation
4. Persistence
5. Covering your Tracks

You are most likely looking at spending most of your time in the first three stages. 

## First: Quick Wins
- Do you scanning and enumeration, looking for an easy path to escalation (a quick win; low-hanging fruit).
- If that doesn't get you anywhere, then you'll have to dig deeper.

## Overview of Quick Wins:
1. Find out who you are on the compromised machine.
2. Find out the architecture of the compromised machine.
3. Find out what history is available to you on the compromised machine.
4. Find out what sudo privileges you have on the compromised machine.
