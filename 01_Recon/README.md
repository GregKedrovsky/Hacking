# Recon: Information Gathering

> The first phase of any pentest reconnaissance (gathering information). The more information you have, the more successful you will be during the latter stages of a pentest.

## Types

- [Passive Info Gathering](https://github.com/GregKedrovsky/Hacking/blob/main/01_Recon/recon1_passive.md#passive-recon): gathering info w/o actively engaging the target systems (OSINT).
- [Active Info Gathering](https://github.com/GregKedrovsky/Hacking/blob/main/01_Recon/recon1_active.md): gathering info by actively engaging the target systems (need permission).

## Examples
