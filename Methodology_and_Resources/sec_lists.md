# SecLists | Wordlists

[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) (by Daniel Miessler) is a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments.
- List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more.
- The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.
 
## Install in Kali:
